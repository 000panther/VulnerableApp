# XSS based Injections
XSS_VULNERABILITY=Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into \
otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code,\
 generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed\
  are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output \
  it generates without validating or encoding it. <br/> <br/> An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user.\
  The end user\u2019s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script.\
   Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens,\
    or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content\
     of the HTML page. <br/><br/> For more information on XSS: <ol><li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Owasp XSS</a> \

# UNRESTRICTED_FILE_UPLOAD_VULNERABILITY
UNRESTRICTED_FILE_UPLOAD_VULNERABILITY=Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed.\
<br/>The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database, forwarding attacks to back-end systems, client-side attacks, or simple defacement. It depends on what the application does with the uploaded file and especially where it is stored.\

# Command Injection Attack
COMMAND_INJECTION_VULNERABILITY=Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system \
via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) \
to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. \
Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation. <br/><br/>\

# SQL Injection Vulnerability
SQL_INJECTION_VULNERABILITY=A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data \
from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), \
execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present \
on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, \
in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands. <br\> \
